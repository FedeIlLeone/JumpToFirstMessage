# JumpToFirstMessage

Replugged plugin that adds a button to jump to the first message of a channel.

Inspired by Reddit's "Back to Top" button in posts. The button is disabled by default in all the
other channels, just to stay on the initial concept of the button. In fact I think Discord should
add this functionality for all posts in the forum channels.
